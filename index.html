        <h2>🚀 About Me</h2>
        <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInDown">class="animate__animated animate__fadeInDown"
          I’m a passionate and visionary coder with a strong commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology. From crafting dynamic websites and building intelligent robots to diving deep into the world of AI, blockchain, and cybersecurity, I thrive on challenges that allow me to merge creativity with technical mastery. My journey began with simple lines of code and quickly evolved into building entire ecosystems — like my very own programming language, “Oerion,” and a range of smart, AI-powered systems that reflect both innovation and practical utility.
          <br><br>
          As a self-motivated learner and multi-talented creator, I bring experience in full-stack development, mobile apps, machine learning, game development, and video editing — always aiming to create solutions that are not just functional, but truly meaningful. Whether I’m developing a decentralized app, crafting a cinematic video edit, or architecting a secure digital experience, I approach each project with discipline, originality, and a hunger to learn more.
          <br><br>
          My mission is simple: to transform ideas into impactful digital experiences that solve real-world problems. Every line of code I write, every interface I design, and every product I build is driven by purpose, passion, and precision.

        <h2>🤖 Robot – Oerion</h2>
        <p>
          Oerion was not just a project — it was the spark of my innovation journey. I had a vision to create something extraordinary, something that could combine artificial intelligence with real-world utility. However, I was limited by time and funds. Still, with the help of my school’s support and partial funding, I brought this dream to life.
          <br><br>
          The robot came equipped with a smart <strong>128x64 display</strong>, allowing it to show real-time status and messages. At its core, it ran on a custom-built programming language called <strong>"Oerion"</strong> — designed and coded by me. This language gave the robot superpowers, like identifying faces using a camera and providing relevant details about them.
          <br><br>
          But that’s not all. I added motorized movements to make Oerion mobile and functional. Its arms were controlled with precision, and yes — the robot could move its hands just like a human! I integrated smartphone control, so every part of the robot could be accessed wirelessly.
          <br><br>
          Audio responses were handled through a built-in speaker, and the display delivered a visual UI for better user interaction. It could walk, talk, analyze, display, and interact — and all of this was done with minimal resources.
          <br><br>
          I believe that with more time and better funding, Oerion could have been an even more powerful creation. But this version, built with heart and hustle, remains one of my proudest achievements and a true symbol of passion, innovation, and creativity.

        <h2>🍼 Automatic Baby Cradle</h2>
        <p>
          This project holds a special place in my heart — not just because of its technical brilliance, but because of its ability to bring comfort and ease to parents and babies alike. The <strong>Automatic Baby Cradle</strong> was designed to gently rock the cradle without manual effort, soothing a baby to sleep using smart automation.
          <br><br>
          The system used sensors and a motorized setup controlled by a microcontroller (like Arduino or ESP32). When the baby cried or moved, the cradle would detect motion or sound and automatically begin a soft rocking motion. The rocking speed and time were adjustable for maximum safety and comfort.
          <br><br>
          I also added a <strong>Bluetooth module</strong> for wireless control via smartphone, allowing parents to start, stop, or customize the cradle’s movement from their phones. The cradle also featured a <strong>lullaby speaker</strong> system that played soft music or white noise to help calm the baby.
          <br><br>
          I built this project during a time of limited resources, yet it worked beautifully — blending emotional intelligence with technical automation. I dream of upgrading it further with AI, camera-based baby monitoring, and voice control. But even this version was deeply appreciated by everyone who saw it.
          <br><br>
          For me, this was more than a project — it was about empathy, innovation, and solving real-life problems with the power of technology.

        <h2>📵 Mobile Network Jammer</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>Mobile Network Jammer</strong> is one of my most thrilling and technically bold projects. Built to block cellular communication within a specific range, this jammer was designed to cut off mobile network signals (2G/3G) in a controlled environment for security, study, or demonstration purposes.
          <br><br>
          This device works by transmitting signals on the same frequency as mobile devices, creating enough interference to block communication between the phone and the nearest tower. While it was a school-level prototype, it showed how radio frequency manipulation can impact real-world technologies.
          <br><br>
          Core Highlights:
          <ul>
            <li>📶 Blocks mobile networks in a short-range area</li>
            <li>🔧 Custom-built RF oscillator and amplifier circuit</li>
            <li>⚠️ Low-range, non-harmful, for educational use only</li>
            <li>📦 Compact design with built-in switch and indicator</li>
            <li>🔋 Powered by 9V battery for portability</li>
          </ul>
          Although the range was limited, the results were fascinating. Phones within the jammer's radius would drop network bars to zero. Due to legal constraints, this device was never used outside demonstrations or secured zones.
          <br><br>
          Designed under tight constraints – <strong>low budget and limited parts</strong> – yet with enough innovation to get noticed by school tech mentors. If supported with proper filters, shielding, and frequency sweepers, it can be scaled to work on multiple bands.
